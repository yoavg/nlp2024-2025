# Intro to NLP 2024-2025, Assignment 3.

**Trying to help people get their rights!**

**IMPORTANT**: The assignment has two parts. Part 1 is to be submitted **before** Part 2.

## Introduction

This assignment is about retrieval for question answering. To spice things up, we will work in a setup where the technology and models are not as mature as in English, which will highlight multiple challenges of building NLP systems of this kind. You will create an end-to-end system, with multiple components, that has to work "for real". The problem specification is clear, but we leave the solution somewhat open, to allow you to experiment with the different tradeoffs. As usual the report you will produce is a major part of the grade, so invest in it.

The system you will build will be a **question answering (QA) system** that will help people in Israel understand their rights, by answering questions on materials from the  [כל זכות](https://www.kolzchut.org.il/) **כל זכות** website. (Yes, this means working in Hebrew, where a lot of the challenge comes from). We will create a **"retrieval augmented generation" (RAG)** system, which means that it involves both retrieval an LLMs.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

While we will cover it more formally later in class, the idea of RAG is very simple: when we ask an LLM a question, we also populate the prompt with additional material to help answer the question. In other words, the flow is as follows:

1. User sends a question to the system.
2. The system attempts to retrieve documents from some database, that are likely to contain an answer to the question.
3. The top retrieved document are sent, together with the user's question, to an LLM, in a prompt that says "Consider these documents and answer the following question based on them".
4. The LLM's response is returned to the user, either with or without pointers to the retrieved documents.

Our focus in this assignment will be on items 2 and 3 of this flow.

### Data Collection

Part of the development of an NLP system is to think about the task definition and the data collection. Hence, the first part of this assignment will be dedicated to such data collection.

### Technical Notes:

**Installing packages**: In this assignment and others, we mention various python packages you need to use, as well as instructions on how to install them. For each of them, you are advised/expected to also look at their documentation online. While our installation instructions are to use `pip install` directly, this installs the packages to your main python environment. It is fine, but the current "best practice" in the industry is to install the needed packages for each project in their own "virtual environment". If you want to learn more about virtual environments and tools for managing them, you can google for `venv`, `python uv`, `python poetry` or `pipenv`.

**Using GPU**: The assignment does not require the use of a GPU. While it does involve running neural models, we do not require training and the amount of text is such that can be handled also on a CPU (although it might take a few hours to run). Having said that, GPU can definitely speed some things up. If you want to take advantage of GPU, [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides some free GPU hours to its users (and of course you are welcome to use whatever other GPU you have access to).

**LLMs**: This assignment involves the use of a large language model (LLM). You can use whatever LLM is convenient for you. Commercial LLMs (for example by OpenAI, Anthropic or Google) are available for use through simple web-based APIs with python clients to use them (for example, `pip install openai` for GPT, `pip install anthropic` for Calude, `pip install google-generativeai` for Gemini). We are sure you could figure it out. Open LLMs can be downloaded and run locally through projects like [ollama](https://ollama.com/), or through API providers such as [together.ai](https://docs.together.ai/docs/chat-overview).
API use is more convenient, often faster, and sometimes higher quality, but also costs a bit of money (though some providers have some free tiers for a small amount of tokens per month, which should be sufficient for this assignment. Currently, Google offers such a free tier for its gemini-1.5 model). We expect the cost of LLM calls for this project, even through an API, to be very small (we do not require many calls and many tokens, and current prices for the entry-level models are around 0.15 USD for 1M input tokens, and 0.6 USD for 1M output tokens), but you can decide if you want to use an API or run a model locally for free. (If using a paid API, make sure to use the pricing of different providers and their models by googling `provider-name api pricing`).

## Part 0: The data (0 points)

The [kolzchut.tgz](https://github.com/yoavg/nlp2024-2025/releases/download/ass3-data/kolzchut.tgz) file contains the HTML text of over 3000 Hebrew pages from the כל זכות website. 

We also provide the following script:

- [src/get_random_page.py](src/get_random_page.py)

Extract the files from `kolzchut.tgz` and see that you get the `get_random_page.py` script to work. Running it should print three lines: a URL, a file-name, and an ID. You can then open either the file or the URL in your browser (on most OSs, the file should open automatically, but the URL will lead to the website itself, which has nicer styling).

## Part 1:  Dev-set Creation and Warm-up (35 points), submit a week from publication.

In this part, you will create a small annotated dev-set data for evaluating (and for developing) the retrieval part of your project. 

You will also get up-to-speed with indexing, retrieval and using LLMs on some English data.

**You will submit this set by the end of the first week** and we will collect all of your individual submissions and release a test-set based on a subset of them. You will have to submit results of your system on the joint test set in your final report.

### Part 1a: Dev-set Creation (20 Points)

The task we are attempting to solve is to answer questions based on the data in the כל זכות corpus, that is, to answer questions that will help people understand the rights available to them, and how to use them.

But how do such questions look like? This is up to you to think of and define, and we ask you to think of (at least) 20 different questions (or queries) to use in your dataset.

The process that we ask you to follow is to sample a random page (using the [src/get_random_page.py](src/get_random_page.py) script provided in part 0), look at it, and try to think of a question that this page answers, and that someone might look for. Once you found a question, record the page, the question, and text from the page that answers this question (the text may come from different parts of the page). Do this until you have **questions from 20 different pages**. (You can have more than one question per page if you want, but you are _required_ to provide 20 pages with at least one question about each).

**What questions to ask?** This is entirely up to you, the main criteria is that the question will be something that someone may realistically want to get an answer for. Note however that the questions are to be part of a search system, that is, while _you_ see the page when answering the question, the user will not see the page, and this will affect the kind of questions they are likely to ask. That is, if the question contains details you are likely not expected to know without reading the page, then it is likely not a good question for this project.

Questions come in many shapes and form, among other things, they can be:
- **Binary**: האם אדם שברשותו דירה זכאי לקבל סיוע בשכר דירה מהמדינה
- **Open with a short answer**: עד כמה חודשים לאחר השחרור זכאי אסיר משוחרר לסיוע בשכר דירה
- **Open with a long answer**: אילו טפסים אלמנים או אלמנות שרוצים לקבל שיקום תעסוקתי צריכים להגיש, ולאן

In all of these, the answer is expected to be on a single page. There are also questions whose answers are likely to be spread across many pages:

- **Aggregate answers**: אילו זכויות מגיעות לאסירים משוחררים

Your questions could also take the form of a query, if you prefer:
* **Query-like**: זכויות אסירים משוחררים דיור

It is OK to include questions from all these kinds, though try to balance between questions that require aggregate answers and ones that don't, leaning towards questions that do not require aggregation over multiple pages. (it is up to you though to decide on the kinds of question you find most interesting / useful).

Of course, you need the question to be also something that you think will be possible to answer. However, try to make things not be "too easy", by not following the language in the page exactly, but to ask a question which differs somewhat in its language than the phrasing of the answer on the page.

For each question you create, we ask you to create two versions, which are paraphrases of each other in different words.

To keep the scope of this project to NLP, **avoid asking questions whose answers require understanding a table**.

#### Easy or hard?

It is tempting to create questions that are easy to answer using the existing technology, so that the system you develop in part 2 will be able to answer them. However, try to avoid this temptation: we want our questions to be somewhat realistic, so that our evaluation will reflect what will happen with real queries of actual users. To help you avoid the temptation, we will also score your questions based on their hardness: you want at least some of your questions to not be answerable by **other** systems. An ideal question will be answerable by some systems, but not by all of them.

#### What you need to submit

You need to create a dataset of at least 20 queries and their expected answers, each of the 20 queries form a different page. Submit a `queries.csv` file with 5 columns, in this order:

- The ID of the page containing the answer (the ID has 8 numbers and letters, and is derived from the filename. Each file has the form `pages/ID.html` )
- The first paraphrase of the question or query
- The second paraphrase of the question or query
- "True" if you expect to all the answer to appear on this page, and "False" if this query may have additional parts of the answer in other pages.
- Text from the page that answers the query/question (can be non-contiguous)

The fourth column is for "aggregate" questions ("True" for non-aggregate, "False" for aggregate). For aggregate questions, it is sufficient to include a single page from the answer, but try to make it a **central page**, for this question.

Each line should be a single question. You should have exactly 20 lines (or more, if you create more than 20 questions). It is best to create the `queries.csv` file by writing in a spreadsheet (such as google-sheets or excel) and exporting to `.csv` ("download as .csv" for google sheets, `save as` for excel).

### Part 1b: Indexing and Retrieval Warm-up (15 points)

The file [docs.jsonl](docs.jsonl) contains 5000 short documents, each document is a json dict containing a "doc_id" field and a "text" field.

The file [queries.jsonl](queries.jsonl) contains 50 queries, each of them associated with the doc_id of a document which contains their answer.

#### Reading the files

Verify that you know how to read the files. You can parse each line into a dict using the `json.loads` function of python's builtin [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) module. 

#### Lexical Indexing with BM25 

To create a BM25-based index, you can use the [bm25s](https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s) python package (`pip install bm25s[full]`). It is fast and easy to install and use. While it won't work well with very large indices, our corpora in this assignment are small, and the package is convenient.

Sparse lexical indices coupled with BM25-ranking can be very effective, and quite competitive, especially for longer queries, but also for short ones.

Write a program that uses the `bm25s` package to index the 5000 documents in `docs.jsonl` and then retrieve the 5 most relevant documents for each query in `queries.jsonl`.

```python
import bm25s
corpus = [d["text"] for d in docs]
index = bm25s.BM25()
corpus_tokens = bm25s.tokenize(corpus)
index.index(corpus_tokens)
doc_indices = index.retrieve(bm25s.tokenize(query), k=10)
```

#### Dense (Vector-based) Indexing

In this approach, each unit is associated with a vector, and during retrieval we encode our query as a vector, and look for the K most similar vectors to our query vector.
The question, then, is how to obtain the vectors (of course, the assumption is that the vectors encode some sort of semantic similarity). 

Create a dense index of the documents in the `docs.jsonl` file.

For our purposes, a dense index will be a pair of `numpy` arrays:[^1]

- `vecs`, an array of size (5000 x DIM) or (DIM x 5000) where DIM is the embedding dimension for each doc, and 5000 is the number of documents.
- `doc_ids` an array of 5000 strings, each representing a doc-id.

The two arrays should be parallel: `vecs[i]` is the representation of the doc whose doc_id is `doc_ids[i]`.

**How to obtain document vectors**

Here are a few options:

1. **Combine static word vectors**. Each text is represented as an average or a weighted sum over the individual word vectors.
2. **Combine contextual word-vectors**. Again, each text is represented as an average or a weighted sum of the contextualized vectors of its individual tokens. You can use existing pre-trained BERT-like models that are available in the Hugging-face `Transformers` library, for example `roberta-base` which you already used in assignment 2. Note: make sure you take the average of the hidden layer (for roberta-base, this means dim=768) and not of the word-vocabulary layer (which has a much higher dimension) . This is achieved by loading the model with `AutoModel.from_pretrained` rather than `AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained`.
3. **Use a pre-trained text embedder**, which is trained specifically for encoding texts as single vectors.  The  [sentence-transformers](https://sbert.net/) package has some [pre-trained models](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html) which are easy to use. LLM APIs of providers like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings?lang=node) and [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/embeddings)and [Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings) have `embedding` endpoints that will embeddings for provided texts

**Technical Hints**

When embedding texts into vectors, collect the embedded vectors into a python list (each vector is an item in the list, and can be either a list of floats or a numpy vector). Then, you can convert the list into a numpy array with `arr = numpy.array(our_list)`.

You can save a numpy array using the `numpy.save` function and load it with `numpy.load`:

```python
import numpy as np
arr1 = np.array(["abc","def","ghi"])
arr2 = np.arrau([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
np.save(open("arr1.npy", "wb"), arr1)
np.save(open("arr2.npy", "wb"), arr2)
loaded_arr1 = np.load(open("arr1.npy", "rb"))
```

Searching the vecs array for similar vectors to a vector Q can done using:

```python
scored = vecs @ Q
topK = numpy.argsort(-scored)[:K]
ids = doc_ids[topK]
```

You can then get the corresponding doc-ids using `doc_ids[topK]`.

To convert a pytorch tensor to a numpy array/vector, use: `arr = pt.detach().cpu().numpy()`.

**Create three indices**:

1. average static word vectors based on `word2vec-google-news-300` (from assignment 2).
2. average contextual vectors from the `bert-base-uncased` model.
3. using the pre-trained  `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1` model from the `sentence-transformers` package.

Save each index (the `vecs` and `doc_ids` arrays) to its own file.

**Sanity check**:

For each index, retrieve the 10 most similar documents to the first document in `docs.jsonl`. Does the results make sense? They should.
#### Evaluation

For each of your 4 indices (bm25, dense-static-word-vectors, dense-avg-roberta, dense-pre-trained) compute recall@20 and MRR (as seen in class) for all queries in `queries.jsonl`.

(This requires writing code to compute both MRR and recall@20).

For the dense indices, retrieve using the **cosine-similarity** metric.

_Note_: results for the pre-trained dense vectors should be very high, because the models was trained specifically for this task, and it is likely that our data was also part of its train-set.

#### What to submit

We ask you to only submit two files:

- _q1.txt_ should have 4 lines, each with the top scoring doc_ids for the first query in `queries.jsonl`, separated by whitepace:

```
top scoring ids using bm25
top scoring ids using avg of static word vecs
top scoring ids using avg of bert-base-uncased
top scoring ids using pre-trained multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1
```

- _scores.txt_ should have 4 lines, each with the recall@20 and MRR scores over all queries in `queries.jsonl`. The format of each line should be two numbers separated by whitespace.

```
recall@20 and MRR using bm25
recall@20 and MRR using avg of static word vecs
recall@20 and MRR using avg of bert-base-uncased
recall@20 and MRR using pre-trained multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1
```

### Part 1c: LLM Warm-up (0 points)

Make sure you manage to use `ollama` or `an API` to send a prompt to an LLM and get a response, via code. Nothing to submit for this part.

### When and what to submit for Part 1:

You need to submit 3 files as described above:
- `queries.csv` - the queries you created for כל זכות. (Part 1a)
- `q1.txt` - top scoring doc-ids for query 1, for different indexes. (Part 1b)
- `scores.txt` - recall@20 and MRR for all queries, for different indexes. (Part 1b)

You need to submit this part by **Dec 26, 2024**.

# Footnotes

[^1]: This is very common, and there are systems like FAISS or Vespa that allow to perform efficient k-most-similar searches on large vector collections, with billions of vectors. However, for our small corpus, we can just keep all the vectors as a `numpy` array, and search using a simple dot-product operation.
[^2]: In both cases, make sure that you use the representation vectors and not the vocabulary-prediction vectors, which are much larger (use `BertModel` and not `AutoModelForMaskedLM`). 
[^3]: Unless you really really want to. Note that the `sentence-transformers` package provides training code.
[^4]: Note that you can include exactly what you retrieved, or something a bit different. For example, if you retrieved a piece of text that resulted from page X, you may include in the prompt also additional information from page X, if you think it is useful.
